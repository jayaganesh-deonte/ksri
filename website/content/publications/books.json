It includes Kālidāsa, Vararuci, Aśvaghoṣa, Bhāravi, Bhaṭṭi, Māgha Kṣemendra, Hemachandra, et. al. and their poetic creations. A separate section is devoted to the discussion of the historical aspect of Sanskrit drama and dramatists.  “It is a very difficult work to give a brief account of the whole Sanskrit literature in English by various Western scholars is available. But such a history in Sanskit is very rare.”\\nDr. Raghunath Ghosh, Prabuddha Bharata.",

All these verses form eulogies on the rulers of the three ancient Tamil kingdoms of Pāndya, Cera, Cola in South India, suggestive of their qualities of love, philanthrophy and valour and have a distinct charm of their own. The book is provided with an informative Introduction, Notes and Glossary. It attempts to familiarise the norms and charms of early poetry to students of literature outside the land of Tamils.    “The transcomposition of Muttoḷḷāyiram is very ‘pleasing and instructive'.

It is a thesis presented to the University of Madras in 1930 by P.S.Subrahmanya Sastri - a versatile scholar in Sanskrit and Tamil with equal proficiency. He has established the Tolkāppiyanār of the pre-Christian era was fully aware that Tamil was not related to Sanskrit either morphologically or genealogically. But Tolkāppiyanār exploited the ideas contained in the earlier grammatical literature in Sanskrit, particularly the Ṛkprātiśākhya, Pāṇinīya-śikṣā and Yāksa's Nirukta. He has also refuted the ideas of the later grammarians like the author of the Vīracoliyam who opined close family realtionship between Tamil and Sanskrit. “He presented the whole discussion in five chapters, namely 1) speech sounds, 2) sandhi, 3) declension of nouns and verbs, 4) compounds and 5) syntax. He also attempted at several innovative conjectures with regard to the origin of several grammatical elements.   “This book remains as a best handbook for the Sanskritists to learn the grammatical tradition of not only Tamil but also of the Dravidian languages.   “Further this book proves beyond doubt that the horizontal and vertical migrations of different speech communities could also be ascertained through the linguistic approach.  “This reprint stands valid even today, for many of the issues discussed by the veteran scholar hold valid even today and demand further inquiry.”\\nS.V.U.Oriental Journal, Vol. 39, Pt. 1&2, 1996.",

    "details": "“‘Porul-Adhikāram', the third division of Tolkāppiyam, the earliest extant Tamil grammar, deals with poets. Detailing the subject matter suitable for Tamil poetry, the bok furnishes a volume of information regarding the cukture and customs prevailing in the Tamil land during those by-gone days as such is very important for researchers in the field.   “Dr. P.S.S. Sastri who has done yeoman service to the study of ancient Tamil grammar and liteature, has in this volume given to this world his commentary on three chapters of ‘Porul-Athikāram' i.e., Kalaviyal, Karpiyal and Porul-iyal, all of which deal with marriage in the old Tamil country among its idegenous folk and the life of people after marriage. They form the basis for later poetical compositions in the land and as such regarding the principles of literary criticism.   “The book has already been annotated and commented upon by eminent Tamil critics, but Dr.Sastri's work is important for two reasons, i.e., its appearance in English and its preparation based on comparison with Sanskritic literary and grammatical studies. The text is re-arranged rationally and its meaning is given in English and critical notes are added. Views of early commentators are compared and criticised and at places new views are stated.   “Thus the publication is a  very valuable addition to our knowledge on the subject and as a first attempt to popularise the book in foregin land is highly commendable”\\nThe  Hindu, 11.10.1953.",

Those who are mentally exhausted after going through books of a serious nature are advised to receive some fresh air by enjoying these satires. “The second part of the book comprises of the critical introduction on Harijīvana Miśra and his plays by Dr. George T. Artola and Dr. V. Raghavan. “The concluding part of the book deals with the text Pālaṇḍumaṇḍana Prahasana critically edited by Dr.V.Raghavan.

The glossary and bibliography add value to the publication.”\\nSudha Gopalakrishnan | Sangeet Natak.",

    "details": "“It is a collection of Dr. S. S. Janaki's writing on a variety of subjects which cover different facets of Sanskrit drama and dramaturgy. “The essays in this volume can be grouped under three or four categories. In one group, she addresses the issue of working and reworking of a specific theme. The theme which gripped the imagination of Indian writers is the dialogue between Purūravas and Urvaśī which embodies many dimensions. It has a cosmology, ecology, the celestial and the terrestial world. Janakiji reflects on these issues with great sensitivity and insight.  “Another group of essays is devoted to Rāma theme. This is a vast subject and there is an impressive body of scholarship on the subject.   Appropriately, she refers to the performance tradition of the Āścaryacūḍāmaṇi, more specifically Kūḍiyāṭṭam. From her analysis it is clear that such devices of change of character could not be represented in drama only through the realistic mode (i.e., lokadharmī).  “In another group of essays, Dr.S.S.Janaki shifts her focus to the difficult and complex text of Abhinavabhāratī by Abhinavagupta. The essay on ‘Abhinavagupta's contribution to Sanskrit Drama Tradition' makes fascinating reading.  “The description of the performance of Ratnāvalī in Dāmodaragupta's Kuṭṭanīmata has attracted the attention of many scholars. It is brilliant exposition of the performance traditions of Sanskrit drama. The essays are full of delightful insights supported by close textual analysis.”\\nDr. Kapila Vatsyayan, Chairperson, IIC-Asia Project, New Delhi.",

One of the branches of Āyurveda in which Dr.Sharma had been working is the Nighaṇṭus which give the materia medica. The Hṛdaya-dīpaka Nighaṇṭu of Bopadeva was edited by him in 1969. He has now offered in the following pages, an edition of a lexicon of drugs etc., called the Aṣṭāṅga Nighaṇṭu. The text as constituted and offered here has 408 verses.  “ The text edited here, follows Gaṇas of the Aṣṭāṅga-hṛdaya and has been quoted by Indu (13th Cent.), commentator on Aṣṭāṅga -samgraha. “ Of the Ayurvedic Nighaṇṭus edited so far, special mention may be made of the large Rājanighaṇṭu (Abhidhānacūḍāmaṇi) of Narahari of Kashmir, which includes a description of the guṇas of each drug and carries the editor's long alphabetical index of drugs extending to 164 pages.  “ It is interesting to note that the text refers to the Prākṛt names and names current among the people and the usefulness of sources of information like the shepherds and forest-dwellers.”\\nDr. V. Raghavan, Hon. Director/ Editor, K.S.R.I, 22.6.73.",

The present book is intended to provide researchers in Sanskrit Language and literature information about source-books to which they could turn for the theoritical and practical knowledge they would require in the successful persecution of their research.  “The first five sections record details of publications of general research works which may be useful to every researcher. The five sections are: (1) General Information: Scope and Field of Research (2) Research Methodology (3) Dissertation Writing (4) Manuscriptology and Textual Criticism (5) Manuscripts Collections and Catalogues.   “Then follow the thirty sections into which the entire Sanskrit literature has been classifies. In each section, the respective source-books have been documented. The last section (i.e. the thirty-sixth) gives briefly source-books on modern Sanskrit writings.\\nS.A.Upadhyaya, Bharatiya Vidya, Vol. LIII, No.3-4, 1993.",

These and other similar considerations must not be lost sight of in appraising Mr. Sastri's performance.”\\nRt. Hon. V. S. Srinivasa Sastri.",
