Janaki's writing on a variety of subjects which cover different facets of Sanskrit drama and dramaturgy. “The essays in this volume can be grouped under three or four categories. In one group, she addresses the issue of working and reworking of a specific theme. The theme which gripped the imagination of Indian writers is the dialogue between Purūravas and Urvaśī which embodies many dimensions. It has a cosmology, ecology, the celestial and the terrestial world. Janakiji reflects on these issues with great sensitivity and insight.  “Another group of essays is devoted to Rāma theme. This is a vast subject and there is an impressive body of scholarship on the subject.   Appropriately, she refers to the performance tradition of the Āścaryacūḍāmaṇi, more specifically Kūḍiyāṭṭam. From her analysis it is clear that such devices of change of character could not be represented in drama only through the realistic mode (i.e., lokadharmī).  “In another group of essays, Dr.S.S.Janaki shifts her focus to the difficult and complex text of Abhinavabhāratī by Abhinavagupta. The essay on ‘Abhinavagupta's contribution to Sanskrit Drama Tradition' makes fascinating reading.  “The description of the performance of Ratnāvalī in Dāmodaragupta's Kuṭṭanīmata has attracted the attention of many scholars. It is brilliant exposition of the performance traditions of Sanskrit drama. The essays are full of delightful insights supported by close textual analysis.”\\nDr. Kapila Vatsyayan, Chairperson, IIC-Asia Project, New Delhi.</p>",

They form the basis for later poetical compositions in the land and as such regarding the principles of literary criticism.   “The book has already been annotated and commented upon by eminent Tamil critics, but Dr.Sastri's work is important for two reasons, i.e., its appearance in English and its preparation based on comparison with Sanskritic literary and grammatical studies. The text is re-arranged rationally and its meaning is given in English and critical notes are added. Views of early commentators are compared and criticised and at places new views are stated.   “Thus the publication is a  very valuable addition to our knowledge on the subject and as a first attempt to popularise the book in foregin land is highly commendable”\\nThe  Hindu, 11.10.1953.</p>",

It is a thesis presented to the University of Madras in 1930 by P.S.Subrahmanya Sastri - a versatile scholar in Sanskrit and Tamil with equal proficiency. He has established the Tolkāppiyanār of the pre-Christian era was fully aware that Tamil was not related to Sanskrit either morphologically or genealogically. But Tolkāppiyanār exploited the ideas contained in the earlier grammatical literature in Sanskrit, particularly the Ṛkprātiśākhya, Pāṇinīya-śikṣā and Yāksa's Nirukta. He has also refuted the ideas of the later grammarians like the author of the Vīracoliyam who opined close family realtionship between Tamil and Sanskrit. “He presented the whole discussion in five chapters, namely 1) speech sounds, 2) sandhi, 3) declension of nouns and verbs, 4) compounds and 5) syntax. He also attempted at several innovative conjectures with regard to the origin of several grammatical elements.   “This book remains as a best handbook for the Sanskritists to learn the grammatical tradition of not only Tamil but also of the Dravidian languages.   “Further this book proves beyond doubt that the horizontal and vertical migrations of different speech communities could also be ascertained through the linguistic approach.  “This reprint stands valid even today, for many of the issues discussed by the veteran scholar hold valid even today and demand further inquiry.”\\nS.V.U.Oriental Journal, Vol. 39, Pt. 1&amp;2, 1996.</p>",

L.S.

The glossary and bibliography add value to the publication.”\\nSudha Gopalakrishnan | Sangeet Natak.</p>",
