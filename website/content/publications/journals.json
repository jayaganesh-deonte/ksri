The corpus of the journal is divided into two parts. In the first part homage is paid to Professor Raghavan by four reputed scholars. In the second we find twenty articles written by different scholars on various aspects of Sanskrit learning. There are also a number of articles dealing with Sanskrit literature and literary criticism.  The articles, excellent in nature and diverse in subject matter, are undoubtedly the best flowers of the mental gardens of the scholars by which they have paid their homage to the immortal soul of Professor Raghavan”.\\nSitanath Acharya, Bulletin of the Ramakrishna Mission, Institute of Culture, 2011</p>",
