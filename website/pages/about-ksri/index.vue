      and facilitating Original Research, Propagation, Publication and Modern
      Communication, Scholar's Gateway, Library and collection of precious
      manuscripts, Teaching and Doctorate Programme, Support and Affiliations to

      Lakshmanaswami Mudaliar, the then Vice-Chancellor of the University of
