          Under Phase 1 all the palm-leaf manuscripts in the library have been
          digitised. The major expenditure was met with from the donation given
          by M/s RANE group, Chennai. Presently old and rare books(more than
          100-200 years old) are being digitised. Thanks to the donations from
          some philanthropists and corporate groups like Dr. Reddyâ€™s Foundation,
          M/s Brakes India Private Ltd., we are in the process of digitising
          more than 1000 books.

          <br />
          Once the digitisation is done, the Institute would upload the
          digitised books/manuscripts.
